# Deep-Learning

In this project we will study how news and sentiment analysis could be used in trading strategies to deal with the volatility movement of cryptocurrencies.<br>
We will evaluate deep learning models using both the FNG values and simple closing prices to determine if the FNG indicator provides a better signal for cryptocurrencies than the normal closing price data.

The project will cover the following processes:
- Prepare the data for training and testing
- Build and train custom LSTM RNNs
- Evaluate the performance of each model
